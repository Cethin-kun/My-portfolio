❀ I grew up in a family that loved Japanese culture, ever since I was a child I'd remember going out with my parents to places like malls then eating at Japanese restaurants like <i>Marugami</i> or <i>Yayaoi</i>,
then at home I'd watch childrens anime like <i>Umaru-chan</i>. So it was a surprise to nobody when I grew up into an Otaku, I continue to live a life filled with cutesy things, I dress in Jerai/lolita fashion,
I continue to eat Japanese food my favorite being Tonkatsu, people do sometimes wonder why I dress and act this way even though I'm Pilipino, and the short answer is that I don't care about what other people think
I simply do what brings me joy in life. Of course I won't always do what I please, I still think about my actions and how they affect others, myself, and the enviornment, I won't do something simply because I want
too, I do the things I like while making sure nothing and no one is harmed.

❀ I have a lot of hobbies, mainly because I'm a creative person and I like to express that creativity in ways like drawing, crocheting, knitting, learning cyphers, and cosplaying, but these aren't all my hobbies,
I also like to play video games like rhythm games, strategy games, and visual novels. One of my favorite rhythm games right now is <i>Pump It Up!</i> I started playing it around last year, my mom introduced me to 
it she told me about how a game similar to it (DDR) was her main source of excersize back in the day, the first time I tried it I struggled so much, making the mistake of choosing the <i>"Normal"</i> difficulty, 
it was a lot more advance than I hoped, but after that I chose a skill appropriate track that I could actually do, I really enjoyed it, continuing to improve, what was once a hard track to finish is now a track 
I can full combo. Another game I love is <i>Obey me!</i> I dont play much of the actual game, but what keeps me hooked is the fandom, I was able to bond with and befriend so many people because of this fandom, 
my favorite character in the game is <i>Leviathan</i>, I have been a <i>Leviathan</i> lover since late 2020, but even though so much time has my love for this character is still going strong.

❀ Another hobby I meantioned was cosplay, this is one of the oldest hobbies I still do to this day, my very first cosplay is of <i>Taiga</i> from the anime <i>"Toradora"</i> despite this it took me till my tween years
to watch <i>Toradora</i>, the anime itself is about <i>Ryuuji Takasu</i>, a high school student whose indimidating appearance clashes with his gentle nature, and <i>Taiga Aisaka</i>, a small, feirce girl known as the
<i>"Palmtop Tiger"</i>. They both have crushes on each other's best friends and decided to help each other achieve their romantic goals. <i>Toradora</i> isn't my favorite anime though, my all time favorite anime, and 
very first anime is <i>Ouran High School Host Club</i> which is a comedic anime about <i>Haruhi Fujioka</i>, a scholar-ship student at the elite <i>Ouran Academy</i>, who accidentally breaks an expensive vase and is forced
to work as an errand boy for the school's Host Club to pay off her debt. As much as I love this anime some of its jokes aged poorly, for example in episode 9 <i>A Challenge From Lobelia Girls' Academy!</i> there
is a joke at the time stamp 11:19 of the episode where the ladies of Lobelia Academy were speaking of how they would take down the Ouran Host club because they claim that the host club was just "toying with the pure
hearts of young maidens" and they proceeded to raise their hand to the sky, while a red white and black flag waved behind them, this caused a lot of discource in the fandom because it was a direct reference to hitler.
Despite all this though it still stands as my favorite anime, because of its progressive protagonist, Haruhi Fujioka is an icon to people who identify as trans, or non-binary, because in her eyes it doesnt matter
weather or not shes viewed as a girl or boy, just as long as shes viewed and respected like a person.</p>
