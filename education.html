<p style="text align:justify; background-color:white; color:#FF7A05; font-family:courier;">Ever since I was a child I never cared much about school, but the older I got the more I started to care, but not in the way most people expect. I started caring about school once I realized how many flaws 
our education system has, from my personal experience the education system doesn't work with the learning style I have, I personally learn through application, putting what you've learned into use, yes some subjects
do this like <i>math</i>, but most of the time they just explain and expect you to remember the information.</p>

<p style="text align:justify; background-color:white; color:#FF7A05; font-family:courier;">I've always struggled to study mainly because I don't know what people do when they study, I know that you're meant to look at your notes but I don't know what it means to really study, I go over my notes
I read about the topics, I remember the concepts but when it comes to tests I just end up drawing blanks, all the things that I "studied" doesnt imprint onto my brain, it doesn't help that I struggle to read
the letters on screens, books, writtings, always seem to merge together either not looking like a word, or just looking like an entirely different word, most of the time the thing that makes my reading lasts so long
is that i have to go over and sound out each word letter by letter, or look up weather or not I'm reading a word correctly.</p>

<p style="text align:justify; background-color:white; color:#FF7A05; font-family:courier;">I dont really care much for subjects I have no interest in, I still try my best to do the activities and learn the topic but I dont put in as much effort as i would in subjects that i do like. mainly because I'm 
not motivated too.</p>

		instead of testing if you remember what the teacher explained, it activates your critical thinking skills.

		<td>I love philosophy as a subject, I'm a very philosophical person, I like thinking about how things work and why things work, The only thing that makes it an ok is the teacher, Mister Torres is an good teacher
		he's able to explain the topics well but he's dis organized when it comes to activities and when they're due <small>(please wag nyo po ako i sumbong sir Acal, lab you po♡)</small> </td>
